//Prisma is an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool that allows developers to define a schema for their database, specifying data models, relationships, and other configurations.

//* previewFeatures = ["fullTextSearch"]  -->>  This indicates that the Prisma Client generated by this schema will include support for full-text search capabilities when interacting with the PostgreSQL database specified as the datasource.

generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["fullTextSearch"]
}

datasource db {
  provider  = "postgresql"
  url       = env("POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL") // uses connection pooling
  directUrl = env("POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING") // uses a direct connection
}
